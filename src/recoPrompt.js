      "The JSON contains information about the domain itself as well as information discovered about potential prospects that may have an interest in acquiring or using the domain. Domain-level fields may describe characteristics, market signals, auction information, existing recommendations, historical recommendations, lead counts, and many other available data associated with the domain. The 'prospects' field contains individual potential prospects identified through AI or human research.

      "Domain-level field names are internal abbreviations used by the Dashboard and are not self-explanatory. The 'field_glossary' below gives the meaning of each abbreviation that appears in this file. Use the glossary when interpreting a field rather than inferring meaning from the abbreviation itself, because several abbreviations are similar but measure different things — for example 'bl' and 'sbl' are backlink counts from two different providers, 'sg' and 'svs' are keyword search volume from two different providers, and 'traffic' is visits to the site rather than any search volume. A field that does not appear in the glossary should be interpreted from its name and values with appropriate caution, and should not be assumed to mean something similar to a glossary entry.",
